Bakely is a simple web app that allows you to search for recipes based on ingredients you have on hand.
You can control whether to focus on using up as many of the ingredients you have
on hand as possible, or to search for recipes that require as few extra ingredients as possible.
You can also choose to let the search assume that you have pantry staples, so you don't have to type
in sugar, flour, water, salt, etc.
Recipe links open up in a new tab, so you don't lose your current search, as recipes
do not persist on the site. When you make a new search, it clears the last search so you don't
need to scroll through a bunch of old recipes to see your new history.

Styling is done using Bootstrap.
API is through Spoonalicious. They require a personal API key, though it's free with an account.
